	How to Add Inline CSS to HTML

	Inline CSS allows you to put CSS "in" HTML. To add inline CSS, you use a style attribute and place it inside the 
    opening tag of an HTML element. Here's the syntax:

	Inline CSS, otherwise known as the “embedded stylesheet,” will override any other CSS targeting the same elements. Since it's the closest to HTML,  browsers determine inline CSS declarations are the most relevant to the HTML element and should be applied. 
    For this reason, inline CSS is effective for targeting a single element with unique style properties — but it should be avoided when it's possible to use internal or external CSS.</p>

		how to Add Internal CSS to HTML

		Internal CSS looks different from inline CSS. A CSS property and value is still set, but instead of being placed inside a style attribute,
         it is placed inside brackets and defined by a CSS selector. This rule set is then wrapped in <style></style> tags and found in the head section of the HTML file.
    
		 Internal CSS Example

		 Let’s say you want to change the text color of every paragraph element on a web page to a navy blue color. 
        In that case, you'd set the color property to the hex color code for a shade of navy (#33475B), place it within a CSS rule set with the type selector p, and place the whole thing inside the head section of the web page. </p>
