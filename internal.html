    <h1>how to Add Internal CSS to HTML</h1> 

    <p>Internal CSS looks different from inline CSS. A CSS property and value is still set, but instead of being placed inside a style attribute,
         it is placed inside brackets and defined by a CSS selector. This rule set is then wrapped in <style></style> tags and found in the head section of the HTML file.
    </p>
    <h2>Internal CSS Example</h2>

    <p>Letâ€™s say you want to change the text color of every paragraph element on a web page to a navy blue color. 
        In that case, you'd set the color property to the hex color code for a shade of navy (#33475B), place it within a CSS rule set with the type selector p, and place the whole thing inside the head section of the web page. </p>
       

<h3>Internal CSS Example</h3>


<p>The default text color for the page is black. However I can change the color of every paragraph element on the page using internal CSS.</p>


<p>Using internal CSS, I only need to write one rule set to change the color of every paragraph elemnet.</p>


<p>With inline CSS, I'd have to add a style attribute to every single paragraph in my HTML.</p>
