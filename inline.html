<h1> How to Add Inline CSS to HTML</h1>
<p>Inline CSS allows you to put CSS "in" HTML. To add inline CSS, you use a style attribute and place it inside the 
    opening tag of an HTML element. Here's the syntax:
</p>
<p><div class="text"><element style="CSS property: value"></element></div>
</p>
<p>Inline CSS, otherwise known as the “embedded stylesheet,” will override any other CSS targeting the same elements. Since it's the closest to HTML,  browsers determine inline CSS declarations are the most relevant to the HTML element and should be applied. 
    For this reason, inline CSS is effective for targeting a single element with unique style properties — but it should be avoided when it's possible to use internal or external CSS.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Example</h2>
<p>Since the default text color for the page is black, the paragraph is black. However, thanks to 
    <span style="color: #FF7A59">inline CSS</span>
    , I can change the color of a few words within a paragraph to orange to make it really stand out.</p>
